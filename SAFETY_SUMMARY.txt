AYSO ROSTER PRO - SAFETY & PRIVACY SUMMARY
==========================================

Dear AYSO Parents and Coaches,

AYSO Roster Pro is a FREE, SAFE, and PRIVATE tool for managing youth soccer lineups.

KEY SAFETY POINTS:
------------------
✓ NO data is collected or stored - everything stays in your browser
✓ NO accounts or passwords needed - nothing to hack
✓ NO tracking, cookies, or analytics - completely anonymous
✓ NO ads or third-party services - just a simple lineup tool
✓ NO player data is sent over the internet - 100% local processing

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. You enter player names (we recommend first names only)
2. The tool generates fair lineups following AYSO rotation rules
3. Everything happens in your browser - like using a calculator
4. When you close the tab, all data disappears
5. Export/import features save to YOUR computer only

PARENT PEACE OF MIND:
---------------------
• Built specifically for youth sports with child safety in mind
• No social features or communication between users
• No photos, contact info, or personal data collected
• Simpler than a spreadsheet, safer than paper lists
• You can verify it's safe - the code is open and transparent

COACH BEST PRACTICES:
--------------------
• Use first names only or nicknames
• Keep exported roster files secure
• Close browser tab when done
• Share this safety summary with concerned parents

TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
----------------------
Tech-savvy parents can verify our claims:
• No external API calls after page load
• No database connections
• No localStorage or cookies
• View Source shows simple, readable code
• Network tab in browser shows no data transmission

BOTTOM LINE:
-----------
This tool is as safe as using a calculator website - it does math 
(lineup generation) in your browser and nothing else. Your team's 
information never leaves your computer.

Questions? Consult with your AYSO Regional Board.

Remember: The safest data is data that's never collected.
That's exactly how AYSO Roster Pro works.
